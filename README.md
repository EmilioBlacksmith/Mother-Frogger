# FROGGER but Realistic and with Funny Physics

Have you ever wonder how a classic videogame such as FROGGER (1981) would look with "realistic" graphics and funny physics just like Humans Fall Flat, Fall guys or Gang beasts?

Well I decided to make a simple infinite game of FROGGER with all of that, the game is softly based on it, but it has a lot of changes in gameplay to take advantage of the current physics based movement of the frog, and the overall environment.

## What can I do in this game?

Well, you can survive with anything, there are multiple options, run like crazy to the other end of the street, put obstacles in the car's path, or go a bit slower, each lane at a time, you decide!

## What do this game have?

- Physics based movement (every joint of the character is physics based and that makes it a bit more difficult to handle sometimes)
- A global scoreboard that can store up to 10 people (so if you want to be on the top 10, good luck)
- A physics based traffic system that can be blocked by using random obstacles from the whole environment
- A simple grab and put system, where you can grab objects from the field, to put them in the environment to make your way to the goals easier
- An infinite loop of the game, the game gets harder the more goals spots you cross at the end of the line, so this is infinite, but be careful, the cars spawn faster, the crocodiles get spawned more often and the cars drive faster too.
- And overall a fun experience (hopefully)

## Where to Play?

This game is available in itch.io or in this repo's releases tab. Hope you like the game, and let me know if it explodes or something.
